This will be the Journal that contains everything you know about certain characters, places, items, quests and events.
# Characters
(DM's note: I divided those into factions for you guys to easier find the ones you know :))

One character I will include before all others, for he does not belong to any of the categories listed below.
- **Madryck Roslof**
	- Description: A warlock of Zybilna the Archfey. Gave us quest to find out what happened to her and give her a hand.
	- Character: Old, wise man with experience in adventuring. Pretty confident in himself, although is now retired.
	- Appearance: Old human, wears black clothing, looks pretty neat.
	- History: Mostly unknown. Asked us to find out about Zybilna and help her, and in return promised us the treasures from his former adventures.
## Witchlight Carnival
- **Mister Witch**
	- Description: One of the 2 owners of the Witchlight Carnival.
	- Character: Serious man, he is not used to goofing around and goes straight to the point.
	- Appearance: A chubby shadar-kai, wears a suit and a cylinder hat. Has Witchlight Watch attached to his belt at all times.
	- History: Mostly unknown. He and his business partner Mister Light acquired the carnival from an Eladrin quite some time ago, when their carnivals crossed ways. They agreed to change back when the carnivals cross ways again, but I presume it takes a lot of time. (Source: Madryck Roslof)
- **Mister Light**
	- Description: One of the 2 owners of the Witchlight Carnival
	- Character: Playful, always weirdly happy man. Unlike his partner, he **is** used to goofing around.
	- Appearance: Slim shadar-kai, wears a jester's suit and hat. Wields the Witchlight Vane, which is a magical item of his own.
	- History: Mostly unknown. All we know about him is the same as about Mister Witch.
- **Burly the Bugbear**
	- Description: Worker at the WL Carnival. Seems to be the right-hand man of the owners. Usually guards the Staff Area in the carnival, but was sent to fetch us when the owners wanted to see our group.
	- Character: Seemingly serious, but it's easy to get him to like you. Likes when children give him apples. Good-hearted guy.
	- Appearance: A bugbear. He wears a uniform and also a helmet made of pumpkin, which he doesn't take off that often.
	- History: Him and his brother Hurly worked for the carnival for a lot of time. His brother mysteriously disappeared recently.
- **Hurly the Bugbear**
	- Description: Brother of Burly
	- Character: Unknown
	- Appearance: Unknown. But he is a bugbear.
	- History: Worked for the WL Carnival with his brother, but mysteriously disappeared.
- **Feathereen**
	- Description: Works at the WL Carnival, specifically at the Gondola Swans. She is the "boat".
	- Character: Seems very wise and philosophical for a swan. Asked us a lot of "sense of life" questions while we were taking this attraction. Seems to have a thing for children?
	- Appearance: A swan.
	- History: Mostly unknown. Enjoys conversations with Burly. She said that his brother never really fit in, but it's still tragic he disappeared.
- **Candlefoot the Mime**
	- Description: Works at the WL Carnival, stands at the Hall of Illusions.
	- Character: He is a mime. I guess that's enough to say about his character.
	- Appearance: Very skinny human-looking guy, wears baggy pixie-looking dress and a gnome hat for some reason.
	- History: In relationship with Palasha the Mermaid. His voice was stolen by Kettlesteam the Kenku, but Ulfugar cared enough to help him.
- **Palasha the Mermaid**
	- Description: Works at the WL Carnival, makes performances at the Silversong Lake.
	- Character: Usually calm and mature, but sometimes can't hold emotions in herself.
	- Appearance: She is a mermaid.
	- History: In relationship with Candlefoot the Mime. Was very grateful to us when his voice was returned.
- **Kettlesteam the Kenku**
	- Description: Second warlock of Zybilna the Archfey, along with Madryck. Caused troubles at the carnival.
	- Character: Causes chaos all the time, but not without a good reason.
	- Appearance: A bipedal human-sized crow.
	- History: Doesn't seem to enjoy Madryck's company, it seems, but didn't say exactly why. Says he is a shady one. However, one thing they agree on is that Zybilna is the goodest of the good in this world, and is very worried about her current state.
- **Ellywick Tumblestrum**
	- Description: A gnome girl who appeared at the end of WL Carnival on the Sword Coast. Paid for our tickets, apparently.
	- Character: Calm, cold-thinking, but at the same time decently kind person.
	- Appearance: A gnome girl with short hair, wears some usual commoner clothes. Plays a small guitar.
	- History: Unknown. Told us some information about Prismeer and Zybilna, but overall not the most useful person we have met.
- **Dirlagraun**
	- Description: Worker at the WL Carnival, guards the "Lost Property" wagon. Also guards children while their parents go around doing something.
	- Character: Usually a calm and charming beast, not easy to make mad. However, when he does get mad, it's pretty scary.
	- Appearance: Beautiful huge panther-looking beast with 3 pairs of legs and a long tail. While on duty, wears a lot of garments and huge vibrant butterfly wings.
	- History: His own cub, named Star, got missing many years ago, and no one knows what happened (similar to Hurly). Ulfugar (again) cared too much and started crying on the spot, swearing that we will find his cub. Dirlagraun then gave us the mirrored ball, saying it was Star's favorite toy. I wish Ulfugar could keep his mouth shut and not giving us more troubles. Well, what can you expect from a dwarf, right?

	- Appearance: Small purple-colored faerie dragon with amazingly good moustache
	- History: Arrived to Prismeer to make a deal with Zybilna the Archfey on behalf of his queen, but was captured by Bavlorna Blightstraw. Then escaped the prison and with the help of Wigglewog the Bullywug used a balloon to escape Bavlorna. Balloon was destroyed by Bavlorna's spell. Wigglewog met his demise. We freed Talavar from his cage with the help of Jingle Jangle from Telemy Hill and he flew away to somewhere. He gifted us his dagger. (Source - Talavar himself)
- **Wigglewog**
	- Description: Bullywug from Hither, helped Talavar
	- Character: Unknown
	- Appearance: Probably a toad, because Talavar described him to us as a bullywug, a race of bipedal amphibian toads.
	- History: Assisted Sir Talavar in escaping captivity and piloted the balloon. Died as a result of Bavlorna damaging the balloon.
- **Jingle Jangle**
	- Description: Cage manufacturer for Bavlorna (apparently, is forced to work for her)
	- Character: Playful, speaks of herself in 3rd person sometimes, weird.
	- Appearance: A goblin.
	- History: Manufactured a cage in which Bavlorna imprisoned Sir Talavar. Later gave us a key to this cage to free him when we told her about our intentions to help Zybilna the Archfey.
- **Tsu Harabax**
	- Description: Inn keeper. Receptionist and one of the 2 workers at the walking hotel.
	- Character: Strange, but kind lady. Pretty nice for someone with elvish blood.
	- Appearance: Old, senile-looking woman, probably a half elf or something.
	- History: Unknown mostly. Works at this inn for a long time, and was managing it before Zybilna's fall. She has a son called Moe, who was helping her around the hotel, but is now somewhere else, doing training of some sort.

	- Appearance: A Harengon with a very long (around 15ft long) sky-blue scarf. Usually wields a buckler and a casting iron.
	- History: Mostly unknown. When he was defeated, his comrades lost respect to him and were no longer obedient. Perhaps title and status are decided with battles in their society? I don't know, but it doesn't matter anymore. Agreed to show us the way to Downfall to track down Bavlorna.
- ***Mysterious Man***
	- Description: Somehow appeared on the top of slanted tower when we were cooking the constrictor snakes we defeated. Looked at us, noted something down in his scary-looking book, bowed to our palading. When I told him to come down and talk, he smirked and disappeared in bloody-colored fiery mist.
	- Character: Unknown
	- Appearance: Looked like a human in a.. suit? And had a book with eye in the center of its cover. It looked from distance that the eye was moving, but it's probably just a mirage.
	- History: Unknown

# Notes
These are important pieces of information about Zybilna the Archfey and the main quest that may help us build the puzzle ahead of time

- Zybilna the Archfey was frozen in time (Source - Carousel in WL Carnival). The method is not currently undisclosed to us, but hopefully we can get some intel from Bavlorna.
- When going through the portal, Mister Witch and Mister Light told me this phrase - "Remember the rule of three - Future, Present, Past. Find the alicorn and free the Dormant Queen at last!". Alicorn? What is that supposed to mean?
